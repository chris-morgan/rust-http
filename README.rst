OBSOLETION NOTICE
=================

This library is DEAD. It was a useful experiment and is now being
replaced under the scope of the Teepee_ (experimentation
grounds at the present) and Hyper_ (actual, usable HTTP stuff) projects.

For some more information on whatâ€™s happened/happening with it all, see
http://chrismorgan.info/blog/introducing-teepee.html.

**YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS LIBRARY AT ALL.**
If you want to use HTTP, I recommend you use Hyper_ for the moment.
